## Broken Authentication (API2:2023 / CWE-287)

Distinct from credential handling: this is about endpoints that should require
authentication and don't, and tokens that are accepted when they should not be.

### Unguarded endpoints

The most common instance is simply a route that nobody protected — usually one
added late, or an internal utility that became reachable.

```bash
# Routes with no guard/decorator nearby
grep -rnE "@(Get|Post|Put|Patch|Delete)\(" src/ -A 3 --include=*.ts | grep -B 3 -v "UseGuards\|Roles\|Auth"
# Explicit opt-outs — verify every one is intentional
grep -rnE "@(Public|SkipAuth|AllowAnonymous)|authRequired:\s*false" src/ --include=*.ts
```

Every `@Public()` needs a justification. These accumulate during development and
are rarely revisited.

### JWT verification flaws

```bash
grep -rnE "jwt\.(decode|verify)\(|jsonwebtoken|jose" src/ --include=*.ts
```

| Flaw | Check |
|---|---|
| `decode()` used instead of `verify()` | `decode` performs **no** signature check — always a finding |
| `algorithms` not pinned | Permits `alg: none` or HS/RS confusion; pin explicitly |
| Symmetric key confusion | A public RSA key accepted as an HMAC secret |
| No `exp` verification | Tokens valid forever |
| `iss` / `aud` unchecked | Token from another service or tenant accepted |
| Weak HMAC secret | Brute-forceable; require ≥ 256 bits from a CSPRNG |
| Secret in source | See `secrets-detection` — `CRITICAL` |

```ts
// ✅ pin the algorithm and validate claims
jwt.verify(token, key, { algorithms: ['RS256'], issuer: ISS, audience: AUD });
```

### Tokens that outlive their authority

A token is a snapshot of authority at issuance. Verify what happens when
authority changes:

- Role downgraded or account disabled → is the token still accepted?
- Password changed or reset → are prior tokens invalidated?
- Staff member leaves → is there a revocation path at all?

Stateless JWTs cannot be revoked by design. Either keep access-token lifetimes
short (≤ 15 minutes) with refresh-token rotation, or maintain a revocation list.
"We use JWTs so we can't revoke" is a finding, not an explanation.

### Refresh token handling

- Rotate on every use; detect reuse of a consumed refresh token and revoke the
  whole family — that pattern indicates theft.
- Store in an `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite` cookie, never in `localStorage`.
- Bind to a device or session where practical.

### Transport and placement

- Tokens never in URLs or query strings — they land in logs, history, and
  `Referer`.
- HTTPS only; `Secure` on every auth cookie.
- No credentials in `GET` parameters.

### Severity

`CRITICAL` for authentication bypass, `decode()` in place of `verify()`,
unpinned algorithms, and unauthenticated access to money or stock operations.
`HIGH` for missing expiry, absent revocation, and tokens in URLs.

### Checklist

- [ ] Every route's authentication requirement confirmed from source
- [ ] Every auth opt-out justified
- [ ] `verify()` used, never `decode()`, for trust decisions
- [ ] Algorithms pinned; `exp`, `iss`, `aud` validated
- [ ] Signing secret ≥ 256 bits, from config, not source
- [ ] Access tokens short-lived; refresh rotation with reuse detection
- [ ] Revocation path exists for disablement and role change
- [ ] Tokens in `HttpOnly`/`Secure` cookies, never URLs or `localStorage`
- [ ] Negative test: request without a token is rejected
